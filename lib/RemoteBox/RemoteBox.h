/*
This library is managning the "remote boxes" connected to any receiver
Each receiver can support up to 8 remote boxes with 15 cues per box (one cue
dedicated to test relays / MOSFETS)
Why only 8 remote boxes ?
Because the MCP23017 is addresed on 3 bits -> 2Â³ = 8
  Fix for this limitation => Use I2C address changers
                          => Use another I2C line
Each box has an I2C input and has a specific I2C address
Every box is connected on the same I2C cable
